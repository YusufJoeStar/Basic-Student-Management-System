This is a very simple Student Management System written in C++. It allows users to:

- Input and store student names and grades
- Sort students by their grades in descending order (Bubble sort)
- Search for a student by name (linear search)
- Display all student records

What's Used:
- Language: C++
- Compiler: Works with any standard C++ compiler (I am using programiz)
- No external libraries needed
